.SYNOPSIS
  Flo Cafe -- standalone Windows uninstaller.

.DESCRIPTION
  Removes the Flo Cafe app, its shortcuts, and its registry uninstall entry.
  Prefers running the app's own NSIS uninstaller silently if it can find one;
  otherwise cleans up the install directory, shortcuts, and registry entry
  directly. Your business data (SQLite database, backups, Master PIN) is
  only deleted if you say so: interactively, you'll be asked Delete or
  Keep; non-interactively, pass -PurgeData to delete it or leave it out to
  keep it.

.PARAMETER PurgeData
  Also delete your database, backups, and Master PIN without asking. Irreversible.

.PARAMETER DryRun
  Show what would be removed without touching anything.

.EXAMPLE
  Download and run directly, no need to clone the repo:
    irm https://github.com/FreeOpenSourcePOS/Restaurant360/releases/latest/download/uninstall-windows.ps1 -OutFile uninstall-windows.ps1
    powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\uninstall-windows.ps1

.EXAMPLE
  .\uninstall-windows.ps1 -PurgeData
