Or grab the latest build directly from [Releases](https://github.com/FreeOpenSourcePOS/Restaurant360/releases) — always the top-most release, filenames are versioned (e.g. `Flo.Cafe-<version>.dmg`):

| Platform | Asset | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| **macOS** | [Mac App Store](https://apps.apple.com/in/app/flo-cafe/id6763136018) | Recommended — auto-updates |
| **macOS (Intel DMG)** | `Flo.Cafe-<version>.dmg` | Direct download for Intel Macs |
| **macOS (Apple Silicon DMG)** | `Flo.Cafe-<version>-arm64.dmg` | Direct download for M1/M2/M3/M4 |
| **Windows** | [Microsoft Store](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9n1md6585p4q) | Recommended — auto-updates |
| **Windows (EXE)** | `Flo.Cafe.Setup.<version>.exe` | Direct download installer |
| **Linux (Snap)** | [`sudo snap install restaurant360`](#install-on-linux) | Recommended for Ubuntu, Fedora (via snapd), Mint, elementary — auto-updates via snapd |
| **Linux (AppImage)** | `restaurant360-<version>-x86_64.AppImage` | Portable, glibc ≥ 2.34 (Ubuntu 22.04+, Fedora 36+, Debian 12+) — [install](#install-on-linux) |
| **Linux (AppImage arm64)** | `restaurant360-<version>-arm64.AppImage` | Raspberry Pi 4/5, ARM servers, Apple-Silicon Linux VMs — [install](#install-on-linux) |
| **Linux (Debian)** | `restaurant360_<version>_amd64.deb` | Debian / Ubuntu / Pop!_OS / Mint |
| **Linux (Debian arm64)** | `restaurant360_<version>_arm64.deb` | Same as above on arm64 distros |

**Uninstalling:** standalone uninstaller scripts for macOS and Windows are attached to every [release](https://github.com/FreeOpenSourcePOS/Restaurant360/releases) — useful if the packaged uninstaller is missing or a reinstall needs a clean slate. They always remove the app and its support files; for your database/backups/Master PIN, run interactively and you'll be asked Delete or Keep, or pass `--purge-data` / `-PurgeData` upfront to delete without asking (add `--dry-run` / `-DryRun` to preview first).

```sh
# macOS
curl -fsSL https://github.com/FreeOpenSourcePOS/Restaurant360/releases/latest/download/uninstall-macos.sh -o uninstall-macos.sh && chmod +x uninstall-macos.sh && ./uninstall-macos.sh
```
```powershell
# Windows (PowerShell)
irm https://github.com/FreeOpenSourcePOS/Restaurant360/releases/latest/download/uninstall-windows.ps1 -OutFile uninstall-windows.ps1; powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\uninstall-windows.ps1
```

## Install on Linux

Three official channels: Snap (auto-updates), AppImage (any distro, no install), `.deb` (Debian/Ubuntu and derivatives).

### Snap

```bash
sudo snap install restaurant360
```

Stable channel is `latest/stable`; pre-releases are on `edge` (`sudo snap install restaurant360 --edge`). Auto-update is on by default — every new tag from this repo lands on `latest/stable` automatically. To pin a specific version: `sudo snap refresh restaurant360 --channel=2.0.5/stable`.

For tails that need a receipt printer over USB without `sudo`, grant the snap a confined-usb override:

```bash
sudo snap connect restaurant360:raw-usb
```

### AppImage (any distro)

Both architectures are signed and bundled in the latest release's assets. From the [Releases page](https://github.com/FreeOpenSourcePOS/Restaurant360/releases), expand `Assets` at the bottom, download the AppImage matching your CPU, then:

```bash
# x86_64 — most desktops, servers, Steam Deck, most VMs
curl -L -O https://github.com/FreeOpenSourcePOS/Restaurant360/releases/latest/download/restaurant360-x86_64.AppImage
chmod +x restaurant360-x86_64.AppImage
./restaurant360-x86_64.AppImage

# arm64 — Raspberry Pi 4/5, ARM servers, Apple-Silicon Linux VMs
curl -L -O https://github.com/FreeOpenSourcePOS/Restaurant360/releases/latest/download/restaurant360-arm64.AppImage
chmod +x restaurant360-arm64.AppImage
./restaurant360-arm64.AppImage
```

If the AppImage doesn't launch on an older distro, `sudo apt install libfuse2` first (Ubuntu 22.04 ships libfuse3 by default; earlier releases like 20.04 still need `libfuse2`). Your data lives under `~/.config/flo-desktop` once running.

### Debian / Ubuntu (`.deb`)

```bash
# x86_64
curl -L -O https://github.com/FreeOpenSourcePOS/Restaurant360/releases/latest/download/restaurant360_amd64.deb
sudo apt install ./restaurant360_amd64.deb

# arm64 (Raspberry Pi OS arm64, etc.)
curl -L -O https://github.com/FreeOpenSourcePOS/Restaurant360/releases/latest/download/restaurant360_arm64.deb
sudo apt install ./restaurant360_arm64.deb
```

Fedora / RHEL / Nobara users: substitute the `.rpm` asset from the same release (filename pattern `restaurant360-<version>-<arch>.rpm`) and install with `sudo rpm -i ./restaurant360-<arch>.rpm`.

## 🗺️ Public Roadmap

Restaurant360 is actively evolving. This roadmap reflects the current public issue discussions as of July 28, 2026.

### Active Priorities

- **Desktop update experience:** Add in-app auto-update support with a notification badge ([#58](https://github.com/FreeOpenSourcePOS/Restaurant360/issues/58)).
- **Loyalty program polish:** Refine loyalty onboarding and labels so staff understand earn/redeem behavior faster ([#81](https://github.com/FreeOpenSourcePOS/Restaurant360/issues/81)).
- **In-app feedback:** Let users without a GitHub account submit feedback directly from the app instead of needing to file an issue ([#141](https://github.com/FreeOpenSourcePOS/Restaurant360/issues/141)).

### Longer-Term Direction

- **Android/iOS tablet client + free e-billing:** A thin-client order-taking + billing surface for tablets on the same local network as the desktop install — same pattern KDS already uses (LAN, no install required), not an Electron port (not possible on mobile). No printer access on the tablet itself; printing routes through the existing desktop install. Bundled: how bills reach customers for free (the already-shipped `wa.me` share link today, richer automated WhatsApp messaging as a possible future step) ([#135](https://github.com/FreeOpenSourcePOS/Restaurant360/issues/135)).
- **Universal tax engine:** Move beyond India-specific GST to configurable surcharges, per-category rates/discounts, and more countries' tax rules ([#143](https://github.com/FreeOpenSourcePOS/Restaurant360/issues/143)).
- **Country & provider plugin architecture:** A plugin system for country- and payment-provider-specific behavior, so tax/provider variants don't require touching core code ([#142](https://github.com/FreeOpenSourcePOS/Restaurant360/issues/142)).
- **Advanced Inventory Management:** Low stock alerts, supplier purchase orders, and ingredient-level tracking.
- **Enhanced Cloud Sync:** Opt-in multi-device synchronization across different branches or franchises.
- **Expanded Translations (i18n):** Add more community-contributed languages beyond the native English, Spanish, and Brazilian Portuguese support.

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|-----------|
| Runtime | Electron 43 |
| Backend | Express.js + TypeScript |
| Frontend | Next.js 16 + React 19 |
| Database | SQLite (better-sqlite3, WAL mode) |
| State | Zustand |
| Styling | Tailwind CSS v4 + shadcn/ui |
| Realtime | WebSocket (KDS) |
| Printing | ESC/POS (node-thermal-printer) |

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js** >= 22.0.0
- **npm** (comes with Node)
- **Git** (for cloning)

Optional:
- Thermal printer (ESC/POS compatible)

### System Requirements

| Requirement | Minimum |
|-------------|---------|
| OS | Windows 10+, macOS 12 (Monterey)+, Ubuntu 20.04+ |
| RAM | 4 GB |
| Disk | 500 MB free |
| Node.js | >= 22.0.0 (development only) |

> **Note:** OS and RAM requirements are based on Electron 43 defaults. The app itself is lightweight.

## Quick Start

### 1. Download & Install

Download the installer for your platform from [Releases](https://github.com/FreeOpenSourcePOS/Restaurant360/releases) or the app stores above.

### 2. First Launch

On first run, the app initializes the SQLite database and asks you to create the first owner account.

### 3. Login

Use the owner email and password created during first launch.

### 4. Configure Printer (Optional)

1. Go to **Settings** → **Printers**
2. Click **Detect Printers**
3. Select your thermal printer
4. Test the connection

## Development Setup

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/FreeOpenSourcePOS/Restaurant360.git
cd Restaurant360

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development
npm run dev
```

### Available Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `npm run dev` | Full app (Electron + backend + frontend) |
| `node dev-server.js` | Backend-only (mocks Electron, faster iteration) |
| `npm run build` | Compile TypeScript (main/ → dist/) |
| `npm run build:frontend` | Static export via Next.js |
| `npm run build:mac` | macOS DMG |
| `npm run build:win` | Windows NSIS installer |
| `npm run build:linux` | Linux AppImage + deb |
| `npm test` | Run all tests |
| `npm run test:upgrade-path` | Migrate a real old-release DB fixture through today's schema — see [Database migrations](specs/DatabaseMigrations.md) |
| `npm run clean` | Kill dev servers on ports 3001/3002 |

> **Adding a column to the database?** If it goes into `createSchema()` in `main/db.ts`, it only reaches *new* installs automatically — existing installs need a paired, guarded migration in `MIGRATIONS`, or they'll crash on upgrade the first time something touches that column. This bit us for real (`customers.country_code`/`tag_counts`, fixed in `9c92409`). See [specs/DatabaseMigrations.md](specs/DatabaseMigrations.md) for the rule and the regression test (`npm run test:upgrade-path`) that guards against it.

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root for custom configuration:

```env
# Server
PORT=3001                    # API server port (default: 3001)
KDS_PORT=3002                # KDS server port (default: 3002)

# Authentication
JWT_SECRET=your-secret-key   # JWT signing secret (default: built-in dev secret)
ADMIN_PASSWORD=admin123      # Initial admin password (standalone server.js only)

# Google Drive backups (optional — off unless both are set, see docs/google-drive-setup.md)
GOOGLE_DRIVE_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id.apps.googleusercontent.com
GOOGLE_DRIVE_CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secret
```

> **Security:** Never commit `.env` files. The default JWT secret is for development only — change it in production.

> **Google Drive backups:** `GOOGLE_DRIVE_CLIENT_ID`/`GOOGLE_DRIVE_CLIENT_SECRET` are only needed if you want the optional
> "back up to Google Drive" feature to be usable in your build. Without them, `Settings > Integrations > Google Drive`
> simply shows "Google Drive integration is not configured for this build" — everything else works normally. See
> [`docs/google-drive-setup.md`](docs/google-drive-setup.md) for how to create these credentials in Google Cloud Console.

## Updates & Database Integrity

Restaurant360 auto-updates in the background on macOS and Windows (checks a few seconds after
launch, downloads silently, applies on quit). This relies on `electron-updater` fetching
a manifest (`latest-mac.yml` / `latest.yml`) from the latest GitHub release — every
release build verifies these files exist before publishing (see
`.github/workflows/release.yml` and `tests/release-config.test.ts`), so a release can't
silently ship without a working update path again.

**Your data is never touched by an update.** The SQLite database, local backups, and
Master PIN all live in the OS user-data directory (`app.getPath('userData')`) — a
completely separate location from the application binary that gets replaced. This holds
regardless of *how* you update: automatic background update, manually re-downloading and
reinstalling from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/FreeOpenSourcePOS/Restaurant360/releases),
or via the Mac App Store / Microsoft Store.

**Schema migrations run automatically and safely on every startup:**
- Pending migrations apply in order, wrapped in a transaction each, tracked via SQLite's
  `user_version` pragma.
- Before running *any* pending migration batch, the app takes a full timestamped backup
  to the local `backups/` folder — not just for specific migrations, but for the whole
  batch, so an install that's been offline or stuck for a long time and jumps through many
  migrations at once is just as protected as one applying a single routine update.
- If a database's schema is *newer* than the running app version understands (e.g. a
  stale install sharing a database with an already-updated device), the app refuses to
  start and shows a clear message asking you to update, instead of silently running
  queries against columns that no longer exist.
- Startup failures — including that schema-mismatch case — are reported through the
  existing anonymous telemetry pipe (on by default, opt-out anytime in Settings →
  Integrations → Privacy) with the relevant version numbers attached, so installs stuck on
  a stale build can be caught proactively.
- A built-in health check (Settings → Database Tools) diffs your live schema against what
  the current app version expects and can safely apply additive fixes.

**Mac App Store / Microsoft Store note:** those channels are sandboxed and manage their
own updates entirely outside `electron-updater` — Apple and Microsoft's store policies
prohibit in-app auto-update mechanisms. Updates *within* a store channel are safe by
construction. Switching *between* channels (e.g. a direct-download install to a future
store install) does not carry data over automatically, since sandboxed apps use an
OS-isolated storage location — use Settings → Database Tools → Backup/Restore to move
data across a channel switch.

### Cutting a release

Bump `version` in `package.json` (and `package-lock.json`'s two matching `version`
fields), add a matching `## [x.y.z] - YYYY-MM-DD` entry to `CHANGELOG.md`, commit, and
push a `vX.Y.Z` tag. That tag push is the only trigger — `.github/workflows/release.yml`
picks it up automatically from there:

1. Creates the GitHub release. **Release notes ("what's new") are pulled straight from
   that `CHANGELOG.md` entry** (`scripts/changelog-notes.sh`), not GitHub's PR-based
   `--generate-notes` — this repo pushes straight to `main` instead of merging PRs, so
   PR-based notes would come back empty. A `## [x.y.z]` entry in `CHANGELOG.md` is
   **mandatory**: this step fails the workflow loudly instead of publishing a release
   with no notes if one is missing.
2. Builds and uploads installers for Linux (AppImage/deb/rpm/snap), macOS (dmg/zip +
   the `latest-mac.yml` auto-update manifest), and Windows (nsis + the
   `latest.yml` manifest) — each platform job verifies its own auto-update assets exist
   before uploading, so a release can't silently ship without a working update path.
3. Uploads `scripts/uninstallers/uninstall-macos.sh` and `uninstall-windows.ps1` as
   standalone assets on the same release (see [Uninstalling](#downloads) above).

## Troubleshooting

### Printer not detected

- Ensure the printer is powered on and connected (USB or network)
- For USB: try a different port or cable
- For network printers: confirm they're on the same subnet
- On macOS, check **System Preferences → Printers & Scanners**
- On Windows, check **Device Manager** for USB printer entries
- On Linux, ensure your user is in the `lp` group: `sudo usermod -aG lp $USER`

### App crashes on startup

- The SQLite database may be corrupted. Check logs in:
  - macOS: `~/Library/Logs/Flo Cafe/`
  - Windows: `%APPDATA%/Flo Cafe/logs/`
  - Linux: `~/.config/Flo Cafe/logs/`
- Delete the database file to reset (data will be lost)
- Run `npm run clean` to kill any stuck processes on ports 3001/3002

### Printing issues

- Verify the printer supports **ESC/POS** protocol
- Test with **Settings → Printers → Test Print**
- For network printers: check the IP address and port in printer settings
- Ensure paper is loaded and the thermal head is clean
- Check printer status via the **Printer Status** indicator in the POS topbar
